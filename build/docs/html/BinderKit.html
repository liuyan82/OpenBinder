The Binder could be described as a "framework framework". It doesn't do anything itself, but is an enabling tool for implementing other rich frameworks, such as the view hierarchy, media framework, etc.<p>
Conceptually, the Binder has many similarities to COM and CORBA  it defines a generic object/component model, a standard mechanism for describing interfaces to objects (through IDL), allows component instances to live in different processes and takes care of IPC details when interactions occur between them, and has a facility for registering, discovering, and instantiating components.<p>
Unlike COM and CORBA, the Binder includes a number of basic features that make it more suitable for system-level programming. For example, the <a class="el" href="BinderIPCMechanism.html">Binder IPC Mechanism</a> propagates the current thread priority across IPC calls, which is important for multimedia applications. It also supports recursion between processes (and generally models IPC as a local function call), so that the system can arbitrarily place components in different processes, depending on security/stability vs. performance behavior determined at run time.<p>
The Binder also includes facilities for registering components (through static "manifest" descriptions, not requiring a registry as in COM), which clients can use to discover and make use of components/features in the system. The Binder system takes care of loading and unloading as needed the executable images implementing components, effectively eliminating the need for manual implementation of plug-in management.<p>
In lieu of a Windows-like Registry, the <a class="el" href="BinderDataModel.html">Binder Data Model</a> is used to provide a hierarchical namespace containing active objects as well as simple data. This namespace is itself defined through a set of standard Binder interfaces, so anyone can implement a Binder component that fully participates in the namespace. For example, there is a Binder component called the "Settings Catalog" that implements the namespace APIs for simple data on top of a flat persistent storage; an instance of this component is placed in the full namespace at "/settings" for others to use.<p>
A rich multi-threaded environment is supported by the Binder, based on a threading model like COM's "free threaded" components. Binder components are generally expected to be thread-safe; <a class="el" href="BinderThreading.html">Threading Conventions</a> describes the high-level threading facilities and guidelines that are used to make it easier to write multi-threaded code and make efficient use of threads in the system.<p>
The Binder Kit is built on top of the <a class="el" href="SupportKit.html">Support Kit</a>, which provides a standard set of basic programming APIs, such as reference counted objects, threading, and containers.<p>
<dl compact><dt><b>Note:</b></dt><dd>The current source tree has the Binder Kit and <a class="el" href="SupportKit.html">Support Kit</a> combined together in the same directory (support). This page only describes the Binder APIs there.</dd></dl>
