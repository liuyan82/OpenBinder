<h2>Bring It On<br>
 <small>by smooved</small></h2>
<p>
System service, if you have any question in your mind as to whether I can satisfy you, bring your requirements to me now.<p>
smooved will satisfy you.<p>
Bring it on to me, and I will do you like nobody can. I will publish your services for you like nobody can. I will provide an auxilary process in which to run these services like nobody can.<p>
I am ready for you now.<p>
Lay your requirements down, and I will show you what makes smooved the only process you need. I will call into your plug-in and obtain a top level GHandler. I will provide your GHandler with only the finest BMessages from the farthest reaches of the system. Then, I will allow your handler to register itself as providing a particular type of service.<p>
We will be launched at boot time. You and I.<p>
All you have to do is tell me what to do and when to stop. And I promise, you will not want it to stop until the power is cycled. Bring your services to me now, and I will show you an ease of integration that you have never known. I will provide your services at a level of availability that no other daemon could ever do.<p>
Damn.<p>
Your plug-in will be loaded into only the most stable, persistent environment. If you have an application which needs backend services, such as a smart card reader or automounter, I will work your backend like it has never been worked.<p>
I will also provide a settings module.<p>
Aw, please, system service. Bring your functionality to me, and I will show you that my architecture is strong. You will ride me all day and all night and will never want to stop.<p>
Baby, I want your plug-ins right now. Give it up to smooved.<p>
I am the daemon of your dreams and desires. I will satisfy you, if only you would allow me the pleasure. I will swear on my honor as a system server that I will do you right until the morning light. I will fulfill your every wish. And I will use locking if necessary.<p>
So, in conclusion, let me summarize by saying that I will load your plug-in and work your backend, then I will feed you BMessages of every kind and variety, and my architecture is strong.<p>
Bring it on. <div class="footer">
